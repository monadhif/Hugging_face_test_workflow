"We are at a pivotal moment for Europe’s AI future. And we need to act now.
This was the clear consensus at yesterday’s State of Europe event hosted by the Jacques Delors Friends of Europe Foundation.
At Mistral AI, we see two critical steps forward. 
Own our AI destiny. Europe must drive demand for homegrown AI, ensuring strategic sectors, especially Defense, rely on European players. Owning our AI and infrastructure is not optional to win the AI race. 
Win the talent war. Europe is a powerhouse of AI talent. Let’s reverse the trend and make Europe the most attractive place for them.
The urgency is shared at the highest levels. I was very pleased to continue the discussion with Commissioner Ekaterina Zaharieva, who confirmed these priorities are central to the European Commission’s agenda.
Thanks Malcolm Byrne, Ekaterina Zaharieva, and Dharmendra Kanani and all the attendees for the insightful discussions and for amplifying the wake-up call Europe needs. The moment is ours to seize."," Europe must drive demand for homegrown AI, ensuring strategic sectors rely on European players . Owning our AI and infrastructure is not optional to win the AI race .
